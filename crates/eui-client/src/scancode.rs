//! The evdev scancode a winit physical key stands for.
//!
//! winit's Wayland backend turns the compositor's keycode into a
//! [`KeyCode`] with a table of its own (`platform_impl/linux/common/xkb/
//! keymap.rs`) and keeps the inverse private. The window needs the inverse:
//! the keyboard state it drives itself (`eui-wayland`'s `Keys`) speaks xkb
//! keycodes, which are these scancodes plus eight, and winit's key event is
//! the only place the key's identity arrives. This is that table, copied
//! rather than derived, and pinned by the test below against the values
//! the kernel gives the keys (`linux/input-event-codes.h`: `KEY_1` is 2,
//! `KEY_A` is 30).
//!
//! Every platform has the type, so the table compiles everywhere and is only
//! consulted where there is a Wayland keymap to consult it against.
